# Destiny-Hash-Checker
A small Java app to brute force Destiny's hash easter egg

Disclaimer : This app is multi-threaded so will absolutely hammer your CPU. I won't be responsible if it catches fire, so please use common sense.

## Usage
Just clone this repo and open up with Eclipse. Pass in an argument for the number of threads you want to run (should be equal to the number of cores) and run the app. You'll see a dot printed out for each 100,000 iterations.
